I’m Sam, a first time developer. 


I like chatgpt, I like club penguin, and I like making things. 


Those three personality traits lead me on a journey to test my creative limits. The question I seeked to answer: Can I fully automate a minigame? 

I made this to test the limits of myself and the limits of AI. Could I make something with chatgpt, starting with only an acute awareness that IF functions existed outside of excel.

The answer is yes, yes I can.

What started as a simple program to match my inputs, and complete levels 1 by 1, has turned into a fully fledged and working, 10000 line, autohotkey-based application (take that, kid from rocket league who told me “your authotkey quickchats aren’t even good”).

Through many iterations I found what worked, and now I want to share with you all the fruit of my labor(ish). Shout out to chatGPT for doing all the heavy lifting and teaching me a little bit about syntax and programming language.

I hope you guys enjoy using it, I will put some guides on youtube as needed.

I will increase the amount of free runs if I start hearing of people using it. But I figured 5 is a good place where it doesn’t absolutely ruin personal economy experiences.
