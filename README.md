This project is a pixel-based input automation tool built to explore how far gameplay automation can be pushed using screen analysis and scripted inputs alone.

It does not read game memory, modify files, or interact with servers. All behavior is driven by on-screen signals and simulated key presses.

The project began as an experiment in automation design and has since grown into a fully featured AutoHotkey-based application with a guided setup process and built-in safety constraints.
